# Socks
A TypeScript wrapper library that simplifies websocket establishment and communication between a server and client.

## Non-mandatory examples:

Clock time synchronization between server and client (somewhat similar to _Network Time Protocol_ (NTP))

```tsx
// TODO: implementation
```

Speed test, including uplink, downlink, and ping between the server and client.

```tsx

```
